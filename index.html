      <h2>How It Works</h2>
      <p class="subtitle">From Bean to Cup—Without the Guesswork</p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>Choose Your Adventure (The Fun Part)</strong>
          <p>Our 90-second flavor quiz matches you with beans that suit your taste buds and brewing style. No vague "light/medium/dark" choices—we ask questions like:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>"When you burn toast, do you (a) scrape it (b) embrace the crunch (c) use it as an excuse for avocado?"</li>
            <li><em>Your ideal chocolate is... (a) Milkybar (b) 70% dark (c) That chili-infused artisanal bar you pretend to like?</em></li>
          </ul>
          <p>Based on your answers, we’ll suggest profiles like:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>The Chocolate-Lover</strong> (Brazilian Cerrado, roasted for cocoa depth)</li>
            <li><strong>The Fruit-Chaser</strong> (Kenyan AA with blackcurrant brightness)</li>
            <li><strong>The Wildcard</strong> (Experimental processed Colombian that changes every season)</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Learn by Doing (The Enlightenment)</strong>
          <p>Every shipment is a mini masterclass:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>"Brutally Honest" Brew Guide</strong><br>
              Unlike generic instructions, ours highlight exactly where most people mess up (e.g., "Grind coarser than you think—these beans clog filters if treated gently"). Includes alternative methods if you lack fancy gear.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Batch-Specific Video Demo</strong><br>
              Scan the QR code to watch the roaster who created this batch brew it themselves in a real (messy) home kitchen. Pro tip: Watch for their "Oh shit" moments when they forget timings—we keep those in.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Tweak or Bail (The No-Guilt Clause)</strong>
          <p>Next month, adjust based on your notes:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>"More body" → We’ll suggest a Brazilian natural process</li>
            <li>"Less acidity" → Switch to a Sumatran with earthier tones</li>
            <li>"Surprise me" → Get whatever our roasters are geeking out over</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Or cancel entirely—we’ll even recommend local cafes that stock similar styles.</p>

      <h2>Our Coffee Offerings</h2>
      <p class="subtitle">Curious Beans for Every Personality</p>
      <div class="offerings">
        <div class="offering">
          <h3>Single Origins <span>Liquid Terroir</span></h3>
          <p>These are coffees with a passport stamp—each bag tells the story of one farm, one harvest. We work directly with growers who treat coffee like wine, experimenting with micro-lots and processing methods that would make traditionalists gasp.</p>
          <p><strong>Current Highlights:</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Honey-Processed Ethiopian Sidama</strong><br>
              The beans are dried with sticky-sweet fruit pulp still attached (hence "honey"), creating a cup that swings between marmalade and hibiscus tea. Limited to 80 bags because the farmer, Elias, only risked 5 trees on this method.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Volcanic Guatemalan</strong><br>
              Grown in the ash-enriched soil around active Fuego volcano. The result? A smoky caramel body with a prickly acidity like champagne bubbles. Pair with dark chocolate.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Night-Dried Rwandan</strong><br>
              A fluke discovery—beans dried slowly under mosquito nets during cool nights develop a rare brown sugar sweetness. The farmer now calls it "lunar process."
            </li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="offering">
          <h3>Blends <span>The Reliable Rebels</span></h3>
          <p>For those who want adventure without volatility. We create blends like a jazz ensemble—individual voices that harmonize.</p>
          <p><strong>Fan Favorites:</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>The Alarm Clock</strong><br>
              (60% Brazilian, 40% Ugandan)<br>
              Designed to cut through morning grogginess: bold chocolate notes with a citrus high note from the Ugandan. Brews well even through sleepy mistakes.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>The Diplomat</strong><br>
              (Colombian, Sumatran, Ethiopian)<br>
              Balanced enough for office pots, but with hidden depth—like noticing the third layer in a good whisky after the third sip.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>The Nightshift</strong><br>
              (Decaf Colombian + half-caf Peruvian)<br>
              All the ritual of coffee with none of the 2AM ceiling stares. The decaf undergoes Swiss Water processing (no chemicals).
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h3>The Oddballs <span>Coffee’s Mad Scientists</span></h3>
          <p>Where we celebrate beautiful mistakes and intentional rule-breaking.</p>
          <p><strong>Current Experiments:</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Whiskey-Barrel Aged</strong><br>
              Green beans rest in used bourbon casks for 8 weeks. The roast tastes like a tipsy tiramisu—vanilla, oak, and a warm alcohol suggestion (0% ABV).
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Carbonic Maceration</strong><br>
              Borrowed from winemaking: whole cherries ferment in CO2-rich tanks. The result? A strawberry Pop-Tart fragrance that confuses your nose before the first sip.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>90-Hour Ferment</strong><br>
              Dangerously extended fermentation creates wild flavors we can’t predict. Last batch tasted like tamarind candy; this one’s giving "overripe mango."
